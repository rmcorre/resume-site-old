# resume-site-old
First iteration of a web app where I can tailor my resume for different employment opportunities.

Unfortunately, I forgot to use Git but spent about 6 months working on it from May-2020 to November-2020.

This was the first project I attempted on my own after completing the Academia De Codigo bootcamp. I used the Java Bank project from the bootcamp as a reference and the new skills I learned from two courses on Udemy. About half way through the courses, I discovered Spring Boot and decided to take this project, duplicate it, and implement SpringBoot in the duplicated project. Also, in the duplicated project, I implemented the views with Thymeleaf instead of JSP.
